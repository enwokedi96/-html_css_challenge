# html-css challenge: Horiseon Solution Services Inc.

## Description

The motivation behind building and deploying this webpage is to refactor code including html, css and markdown best practices. 
This excercise also pushes the boundaries of classroom curriculum and ignites a better understanding 
of these programming languages. The refactoring included shortening style classes for brevity, changing most div 
(at top and sub levels) to sections, and repairing link from top tab to relevant in-page section. A new functionality 
has also been added to aid users easily return to top of page.
